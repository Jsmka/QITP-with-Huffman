# QITP-with-Huffman :smile:

Hi there !!! :wave:

This is a better version of the standard QITP project. In this case, I applied an extra encryption and decryption technique called Huffman Coding to strengthen the security of Standard QITP and provide double security, which is known as Quantum Image Teleportation Protocol with Huffman.
