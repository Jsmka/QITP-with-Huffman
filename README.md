# QITP-with-Huffman :smile:

Hi there !!! :wave:

This is a _better version_ of the **standard QITP** project. In this case, I applied an extra **_Encryption_** and **_Decryption_** technique called **Huffman Coding** to strengthen the security of Standard QITP and provide _double security_, which is known as **Quantum Image Teleportation Protocol with Huffman** :star_struck:.
